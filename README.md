## Installation and Configuration

### 1. Set Database Port to 3307

By default, MySQL uses port 3306, but for this project, you need to change it to 3307. Follow these steps:

- **Modify `my.ini` file:**
  - Locate your MySQL configuration file (`my.ini`).
  - Find the line: `port=3306` and change it to:
	```ini
	port=3307
	```

- **Update `config.inc.php` file:**
  - Locate `config.inc.php` and add the following line:
	```php
	$cfg['Servers'][$i]['port'] = '3307';
	```

### 2. Set Up the Database

- Create a new MySQL database named `inmobiliaria`.
- Import the provided SQL file (`database/inmobiliaria.sql`) into your MySQL database.
- Make sure your database is named `inmobiliaria`.
